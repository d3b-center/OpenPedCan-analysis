Complete 1p/19q codeletion is not compatible with "IDH glioma, subclass astrocytoma" and if present should lead to diagnosis of an "IDH glioma, subclass 1p/19q codeleted oligodendroglioma". This mc is strongly enriched for CNS WHO grade 4 tumours, in contrast to the "mc astrocytoma, IDH-mutant; lower grade", which is enriched for CNS WHO grade 2 malignancies. Astrocytomas with IDH1 or IDH2 mutation can be located in any region of the CNS, including the brainstem and spinal cord, but they most commonly develop in the supratentorial compartment and are usually centred near or within the frontal lobes. The majority of patients present in their thirties or forties (median age: 38 years) with CNS WHO grade 2 or 3 tumours { 26061751 ; 25962792 }. CNS WHO grade 2 and 3 astrocytomas have similar age distributions, whereas patients with CNS WHO grade 4 tumours tend to be slightly older.

Approximately 80–90% of CNS germ cell tumours arise in the midline, most frequently in the pineal region followed by the suprasellar compartment (where they originate in the posterior pituitary / infundibular stalk). Bifocal and multifocal examples (nearly all germinomas) typically involve these sites, but they may also occur in the basal ganglia, thalami, or other locations. CNS germ cell tumours principally affect children, and they are more prevalent in eastern Asia than in Europe and the USA. The subtype KIT mutant is enriched in germinomas harboring a mutation in KIT.
GCT_TERA	GCT_TERA		#996a4d	Germ cell tumours	Germ cell tumours of the CNS	teratoma	Teratoma	The "mc Teratoma" is comprised of tumours consiting of tissue components of the three germ cell layers and occur predominantly in neonates and infants.

Histologically, a fraction of these tumours would probably be diagnosed as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour. Tumours in this group are exclusively located supratentorially. Gangliogliomas have been reported in patients ranging from 0 to 70 years of age, most occurring in the first and second decades of life (median age at diagnosis: 12 years).  Alterations of the MAPK pathway are frequent in this class, and in particular BRAF V600E mutation is highly recurrent. Most cases show a flat profile in copy number analysis, with rare cases showing gain of chromosome 7 and/or X (both in around 20% of cases).

The tumours mostly occur in the posterior fossa and rarely in the diencephalic/thalamic region; median age is 40 years (age range 24 to 75). Deletions of CDKN2A/B are very frequent (>70%). BRAF duplications are also observed in a fraction of cases. Around 50% of cases show an immunohistochemical loss of ATRX. Loss of chromosome 19q (total or partial) is observed in over 50% of cases

DNA copy-number profiles are typically flat. Location is typically in the posterior fossa or spinal; median age is 28 years (range 14 to 66).
IHG	IHG	IHG	#d0bbd8	Paediatric-type diffuse high-grade gliomas	Infant-type hemispheric glioma	Infant-type hemispheric glioma	Infant-type hemispheric glioma	The "mc Infant-type hemispheric glioma" is comprised of cerebral hemispheric, high-grade cellular astrocytomas that arise in early childhood and typically harbor receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) fusions including those in the NTRK family or in ROS1, ALK, or MET. These gliomas appear in the supratentorial compartment, usually as large masses. The median age at presentation is around 3 months (range: 0–12 months). The prognosis is better than for other pediatric high-grade gliomas. Copy number alterations are scarce.
GBM_LYMPH_HI	INFLAM_ENV		#DBDBDB	Inflammatory microenvironment	Inflammatory microenvironment	Inflammatory microenvironment	Inflammatory microenvironment	The "mc Inflammatory microenvironment" does not represent a distinct tumour class but rather a recurrently observed profile of mixed cell types with a high leukocyte fraction (often predominant granulocytic infiltrates). This is frequently observed in highly necrotic tumours, highly necrotic other tissues or when areas of extensive hemorrhage are sampled along with the tumour tissue of interest. tumours with a pronounced granulocytic infiltrate due to other reasons can also get an elevated score for this class. Classification into this class is not diagnostic for a specific type of tumour. A score for this class indicates that the extracted DNA is likely not suitable for classification by methylation profiling. Depending on the degree, copy number alterations may also be masked by the high leukocyte infiltration. The reference class consists of glioblastomas only, but other tumours with high leukocyte infiltration are also expected to fall into this class.
IO_MEPL	IO_MEPL		#46bcd2	intraocular medulloepithelioma	intraocular medulloepithelioma	intraocular medulloepithelioma	Intraocular medulloepithelioma	The "mc Intraocular medulloepithelioma" is comprised of rare primary embryonal neuroepithelial neoplasms of the eye characterized by cords of multi-layered neuroeopithelial cells resembling the medullary epithelium of the optic cup. Most occur in children, age 2-5 years (range <1-66 years), but rare cases in adults have been reported. In contrast to ETMR, they show no amplification of the C19mc cluster and have a strikingly different DNA methylation pattern compared to these suggesting that the ocular and CNS neoplasms do not share common origins and biological behaviors. They are sometimes associated with somatic and/or germline mutations in DICER1.

Location is typically supratentorial and often superficial (involving the leptomeninges). Most case arise in teenagers or young adults, with median age at diagnosis around 20-25 years. There is no apparent sex predilection. The majority of tumours in this mc harbor BRAF V600E mutations and homozygous deletions of CDKN2A/B. Cases lacking BRAF V600E typically show other alterations in the MAPK pathway, including NTRK family and RAF1 gene fusions. Some tumours of this mc also display TERT promoter mutations, which may be associated with a poorer prognosis.
